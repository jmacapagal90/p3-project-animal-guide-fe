We designed an MVP of a Zoo Guide, where a user could browse through habitats and see how many animals were "sighted" in that habitat. The user could also add an animal to a habitat by "sighting" them. The user could also browse through all Animals and view what habitats they currently were sighted.

As a User, I am able to:
- View All Animals
